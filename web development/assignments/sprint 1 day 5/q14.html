<!-- 
Explanation of Changes:
1.label "for" attribute: The for attribute in the <label> tag should match the id attribute of the corresponding <input> element to associate the label with the input field. Also, attribute names in HTML should be lowercase (for instead of Name).
Closing tag for <input>:

2.The <input> tag is self-closing in HTML, so it should properly have the closing > character to ensure the tag is valid.
Incorrect type attribute value for password field:

3. The attribute typ was misspelled and should be type. This ensures the field behaves as a password input, masking the characters entered.
Incorrect closing of <button> tag:

4.The closing tag for the button was misspelled (</buttn>), which needed to be corrected to </button>. Additionally, the type="submit" attribute is required to indicate that this button is used for submitting the form. Without this, the button might not trigger the form submission. -->
